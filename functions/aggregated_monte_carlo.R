#' Aggregated monte-carlo
#' 
#' Creates a dataframe of summarised monte-carlo simulations aggregated from base unit level to higher level for n
#' mutually exclusive groups
#' 
#'  @param df2 a dataframe includes the column matching the geography_name, class and counts
#'  @param prices2 A data frame. has two columns sales_price and geography_name the ID code of the geographical unit
#'  @param number_of_instances A numeric. the total number of monte-carlo instances to perform
#'  @param geography_name a character string. The name of the variable that contains the geography IDs, typically LSOA11CD
#'
#'  @details This is really useful and quite fast.
